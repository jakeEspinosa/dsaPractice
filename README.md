<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms Practice</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This repo contains information about the data structures and algorithm problems I am learning and my solutions in Python. To improve my programming 
skills, I use an Anki deck to present the problem to me at "smart" intervals and then solve it.</p>
